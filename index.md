# Welcome

89 Clouds is a consultancy company operating from London; focusing on Big Data solutions.

Our expertise covers all the areas involved in managing and deriving value from large volumes of data: from log collection to delivering the relevant data to your BI tool.

We are firm supporters of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem, which has become the _de facto_ standard to process data at web scale.

Whether you're running your own infrastructure or using a cloud-based offering like Amazon's Elastic MapReduce, we will help you with

* setting up and configuring Hadoop,
* automating the deployment process and workflow,
* Native or Streaming MapReduce jobs,
* Hive or Pig jobs,
* tying it all together with your existing processes.
